<h5>Fresh Produce</h5>
All the produce we offer in our market is Certified Organic or grown with  organic practices. During the local growing season, we work directly with small local farms who have sustainable practices. Some of the farms we buy veggies from include Kookoolan Farms, Sauvie Island Organic, Bella Organic Farm, Hood River Farms, and Fiddlehead Farm. We get fruit and berries from ProFarm Produce, Springbank Farms, A&amp;B Farms and Hood River Farms.

During the winter, we get most of our produce through Organically Grown Company, a locally based organic produce distributor that specializes in Pacific Northwest produce through their <a href="http://www.organicgrown.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=ladybug" target="_blank">Ladybug Brand</a>. We also use this same distributor for all our tropical fruits and veggies that must be imported from California, Texas or Mexico.
<h5>Eggs &amp; Dairy</h5>
We offer farm fresh eggs from chickens that are pasture raised. Our dairy products also come from grass fed cows and goats. We work with Lady Lane Farms, Fairview Goat Dairy Farm, Patriot Farms &amp; Bison, Misty Meadow, and several artisanal cheese makers, including Full Circle Creamery, Golden Glen Creamery, Rogue Creamery and others.
<h5>Local Dry Goods</h5>
Hummingbird Wholesale, our bulk supplier, works directly with many local farms and helps them transition from simply growing grass seed to growing food.

Our meat is sourced directly from local, small scale farmers, ranchers, and cooperatives. We choose our producers based on a number of practices including no use of antibiotics, added hormones, or genetically modified (GMO) feed. The animals are humanely treated, allowed to free range and graze without confinement. We offer meat by the cut as well as by the side. Our producers include Deck Family Farms, Heritage Farms Northwest, Pat N Tam's Beef, Simply Grown Beef, and others. Our fishermen include Eat Oregon First, Good News Tuna Company, and Yakobi Fisheries.

We also have charcuteries from Olympic Provisions, Chop and Fino Il Fondo.
